# Apis And Postman

## Objectives

  1. Use Postman to explore an API
  2. Read API documentation
  3. Understand the point/value and how to use client id and secrets


## Instructions

 * Focus on the Foursquare API. It's a standard RESTful API, and I think people generally understand it's value
 * Tell them install two tools: Postmand and JSONView. It'll make life much easier
 * Let's try and get venue searching on foursquare to work. Head over to the docs
 * Most of this readme should be translating README documentation into POSTman commands. Reading API docs is a skill!
 * Have them just hit the first url on the docs `https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/40a55d80f964a52020f31ee3`
 * An error!
 * Explain credentials, why are they valuable etc. Just application credentials. 
 * Not actually logged in! Just application auth
 * explain API versioning. APIs are better then scraping because they care about vesioning
 * Do the basic call in the browser, then do it in Postman
 * Give them areminder on how `GET` parameters work
